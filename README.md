This project was made for a computer graphics project at university.
Its main purpose is to be able to visualize OFF-formated files in an easy, fluent manner. 
As of today, the program is capable of letting the user drag and drop an off file into the screen. It will then
parse the file and draw it. It includes phong shading and cel shading, which can be toggled using the arrow keys.
